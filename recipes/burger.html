    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A burger is a popular and versatile food item loved by people around the world. It typically consists of a juicy
        patty made from ingredients like beef, chicken, fish, or plant-based alternatives, sandwiched between two halves
        of a soft bun. The patty is often seasoned and grilled or fried to perfection, offering a rich, savory flavor.
        Accompaniments like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and pickles add freshness and crunch, while condiments
        such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, or special sauces enhance its taste. Burgers can be customized to suit
        individual preferences, making them a favorite for casual meals and fast food dining.
    </p>
    <p>Burgers are not just a meal but a cultural icon that has evolved over time. Originating in the late 19th or early
        20th century, they have since become a global sensation, available in countless variations to reflect regional
        flavors and culinary creativity. From gourmet versions served in upscale restaurants to quick, affordable
        options at
        fast-food chains, burgers cater to all tastes and budgets. They are a symbol of convenience, indulgence, and
        community, often enjoyed at picnics, barbecues, or as a go-to comfort food. Whether classic or innovative,
        burgers
        remain a timeless favorite.
